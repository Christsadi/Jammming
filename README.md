# Codecademy Jammming Project - Part 1 & Part 2

Part 1 of the Project

In this project, I built a React web application called Jammming. I will use my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account. I managed to do this, but struggled to get other users to be able to use the app. For some reason it only works when i log in and i have not found the bug yet.

Part 2 of the Project

To give users the ability to update all of their Spotify playlists and save them to Spotify. I really struggled doing this but manage to get quiet far. I did not complete this part since I first need to fix the bug in part 1.
