# Codecademy Jammming Project - Create a Playlist App With the Spotify API (Part One)

In this project, I built a React web application called Jammming. I will use my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.
